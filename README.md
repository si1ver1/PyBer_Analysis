# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of Project
The goal of this project was to review PyBer ride data based on the different city types: Urban, Suburban, and Rural. Using this information we can provide recommendations for addressing disparities between the city types.

### Results of PyBer Analysis
In the chart below we can see the breakdown of each city type along with some ride data. We can see the as the city type increases in population so do the total number of rides, total number of drivers, and total fare as we would expect. We can also see that the average fare per ride and average fare per driver decrease as we increase in population. This is also an expected change as we can assume a less populated area will require rides with further distances.

By viewing the total fares by city type across the first third of the year 2019 we can see that the different city type's fares never overlap and seem to follow similar trends of dips and rises:

### Summary
Based on the results, there are a couple options for fixing the disparities among the city types.
1. We can increase the fare cost per mile for all rides. Short distance rides such as those in urban areas will only increase slightly while suburban and rural areas will increase more.
2. We can provide incentives for drivers at suburban and rural locations to increase driver counts at those locations. Examples of incentives would be to provide long pickup fees so drivers are more likely to accept rides from further away or to provide a bonus to rides accepted in urban suburban areas (bonus increases the less populated the area is).
3. Another recommendation is to add incentives for riders that live farther away from hotspots (such as downtown, tourist sites, stadiums, arenas, and convention centers) based on their home address saved to their account. Incentives could be discounts or non-surge pricing.
